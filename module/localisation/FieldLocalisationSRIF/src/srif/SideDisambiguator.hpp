/**
 * @file SideDisambiguator.h
 * @brief Out-of-field landmark map and field-side disambiguation.
 *
 * The field is symmetric under a 180 degree rotation about its centre, so
 * on-field landmarks cannot tell own-half from opponent-half. The background
 * scenery (walls, posters, furniture, ceiling structure) is not symmetric.
 * This module builds a persistent map of out-of-field corner landmarks online
 * and continuously compares how well the current pose estimate and its 180
 * degree mirror explain the corners seen now. A decisive, sustained preference
 * for the mirror indicates the filter is on the wrong side (mid-game kidnap /
 * wrong-side convergence) and requests a flip.
 *
 * Pipeline per video frame:
 *  1. FAST corners + ORB descriptors, classified out-of-field (OutOfFieldDetector).
 *  2. SNN association of out-of-field corners to map landmarks: surprisal
 *     (negative log predictive density in the ray tangent plane) nearest
 *     neighbour, descriptor-gated, greedy one-to-one, accepted while the
 *     surprisal beats the uniform clutter hypothesis.
 *  3. Robust side score at the pose and at its mirror: sum of
 *     log(inlier density / clutter density) over accepted associations.
 *     The difference accumulates into a forgetting log-likelihood ratio.
 *  4. Map maintenance (only while the pose is confident and the side is not
 *     in doubt): unmatched corners spawn bearing candidates; re-observed
 *     candidates with enough parallax are triangulated by linear least squares
 *     into 3D landmarks in {f}. Dynamic objects (crowd, robots, handlers) are
 *     rejected by a static-consistency test: the bounded observation window
 *     must fit a single static point (normalised triangulation residual),
 *     and landmarks that are repeatedly predicted visible but not re-observed
 *     are pruned.
 *
 * The map is only trustworthy if it was anchored while the filter was on the
 * correct side (e.g. built early in the game, when the start-in-own-half prior
 * guarantees the side). Map building therefore freezes whenever the accumulated
 * evidence starts favouring the mirror.
